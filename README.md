### Michael Balsa
I'm an IOS developer who is learning in an overview of different languages and frameworks such as Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and Objective C. I enjoy Objective C programming language and building applications in Objective C since it's such a robust, strong language. I also like the Swift programming language with its much faster compiling time and technological advances. I'm also developing my skills in understanding UX / UI design. You can check out my daily IOS development articles on my Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-balsa-9474431b0/ and medium account https://medium.com.
